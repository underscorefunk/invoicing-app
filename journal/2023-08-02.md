Setup the repo and created an initial tailwind template to start scaffolding out the application.

First thoughts:
- Having a cheat sheet to look things up simplifies the use if tailwind
- Having imperative classes in my html isn't as bad as I thought it'd be
- Composing classes together solves the issues I had.

## Next steps:
- Decide how to split up the main window between projects (with timeslips) and invoices (with invoice slips)
